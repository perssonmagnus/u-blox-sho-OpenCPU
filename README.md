# u-blox-sho-OpenCPU
Repository with reference code for u-blox Open CPU modules.

## Introduction
The reference code in this repository is intended to run on the Evaluation Kits
that can be purchased from u-blox.

Data sheets and other information related to the modules and EVKs can be found
at the u-blox website, https://www.u-blox.com/.

## nRF5 SDK
Please refer to the System Integration Manual for each product for help on how
to integrate the reference code in your build environment.

Refer to the EVK User Guide for each board for more information on the specific
board.

## Zephyr
Board support packages for the following boards have been merged with the Zephyr
project mainline repository: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr

| EVK board    | Folder                  |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| BMD-300-EVAL | ubx_bmd300eval_nrf52832 |
| BMD-301-EVAL | ubx_bmd300eval_nrf52832 |
| BMD-350-EVAL | ubx_bmd300eval_nrf52832 |
| BMD-330-EVAL | ubx_bmd330eval_nrf52810 |
| BMD-340-EVAL | ubx_bmd340eval_nrf52840 |
| BMD-341-EVAL | ubx_bmd340eval_nrf52840 |
| BMD-345-EVAL | ubx_bmd345eval_nrf52840 |
| BMD-360-EVAL | ubx_bmd360eval_nrf52811 |
| BMD-380-EVAL | ubx_bmd380eval_nrf52840 |
| EVK-ANNA-B1  | ubx_evkannab1_nrf52832  |

| EVK-NINA-B3  | ubx_evkninab3_nrf52840  |
| EVK-NINA-B4  | ubx_evkninab4_nrf52833  |

Board support packages for the following boards are available here at the u-blox
GitHub repository. They will be submitted to mainline Zephyr in the near future

| EVK board     | Folder                    |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| EVK-NORA-B10  | ubx_evknorab10_nrf5340    |
| MINI-NORA-B10 | ubx_mininorab10_nrf5340   |

Board support packages for the following boards are planned.

| EVK board     | Folder                    |
|---------------|---------------------------|

Board support packages for the followng EVKs are not planned for submission to
the Zephyr mainline project. They will remain here at the u-blox repository:

| EVK board | Folder             |
|-----------|--------------------|
| R41Z-EVAL | ubx_r41zeval_kw41z |

Please store the board configuration directory in the

	<install directory>/zephyr/boards/arm

folder and then build your code for that board.

The board configuration directory also contains a documentation folder.

## NINA-W10 OTP and RF Calibration
This example includes examples on how to read OTP information as well as apply RF calibration and limit TX Power for compliance reasons.
